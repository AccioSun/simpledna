Title: Provides Functions For Analysis of Simple DNA Strings
Version: 0.2.0
Author@R: "Surya Dhulipala <sdhulipala@health.usf.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: Provides functions to analyze relatively simple DNA snippets.
    These functions allow analysis of nucleotide frequency and patterns for
    DNA sequences. The functions expect the DNA sequence to be passed as a 
    string after downloading from various sources. Based on the computational
    ideas presented in the Coursera course,"Biology Meets Programming" by 
    University of California, San Diego.
